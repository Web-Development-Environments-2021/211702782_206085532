The special effects that we implemented are:
1. A special kind of monster that takes twice the lives and twice the points 
of a regular monster
2. An hourglass that if cought resets the timer allowing twice as much time
3. Medicine - allows the player to gain an extra life (under the maximal amount of 5 lives).
4. Special effects - we added an audio element and a popping image to indicate the player that
he lost and special captions above the game to warn him if he had been
caught or won the game.
